# React Sydney Talks

If you'd like to give a talk to our motley crew of React developers / users / lovers / newbies / explorers, we'd love to hear your proposal!

We're trying something different and using GitHub Issues for talk submissions. This way people can ask questions, give feedback and +1 their favourites. If your talk isn't scheduled for the next meetup, leave the issue open and we may invite you to give it in the future (based on theme or time constraints)

After each meetup, we (or the speaker) will update issues with slides, links, and other useful information.

## Things to think about

Have a read through [this slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/LookAtMySlides/codeware). It's a very good overview of how to design a good slidedeck for a technical presentation.

### Slides

Our current venue uses [a dual-projector](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/f/d/highres_463503581.jpeg), plus supplimentary LCD screens halfway along the room.

General tips for great looking slides:

* Use very large fonts and less text per screen so your slide is legible at the back of the room

* If you have code examples, we suggest you make them take up the entire screen with as large a font as possible

* Minimise the use of _long_ code examples and bullet points as they will be hard to read

* If you want to demo something, consider using a screen capture movie or gif. [licecap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap) is a tool that can help with this.

### Speaking

We use a hand-held mike rather than a lapel or headset so practice presenting with one hand [holding a mike](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1523784.1384980457!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/hug.jpg).

Think about where you need your laptop positioned for advancing slides based on where you like to stand while speaking (at the front of the room, or off to the side).

Here's an outline of the equipment available at the venue:

 * Lecturn for placing laptop
 * Chargers available for most common laptops
 * Dual projectors, 16:9 ratio
 * Handheld mic (or lapel mic if necessary, however we've had technical troubles with it in the past)
 * (TBC) recording equipment to record the talk (at your permission)

What we don't have:

 * Slide clicker
 
What you need to bring:

 * Your laptop (we can provide one if needed, but let us know at least a couple days in advance)
 * Your slides
 * A smile (everyone is very friendly!)

### Run sheet

The event will run in the following order (but note the times are estimates, we often run either over or ahead of time - it's pretty casual):

 * `6:00` - doors open
 * `6:30` - Jed + Jess intro the evening / any community news
 * `6:40` - First talk
 * `7:10` - Pizza break
 * `7:25` - Second talk
 * `7:55` - toilet break
 * `8:00` - Third talk
 * `8:30` - Outro by Jed + Jess
 * `8:45` - leave the venue
 
We'll let you know the exact order of the talks before the date (via the GitHub issue) so you're ready :)

It's useful if you can come say to Jess (tall, long dreadlocks) or Jed (err... standing next to the tall guy with dreadlocks ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ) before we start 6:30, we can test your laptop to make sure it connects and there are no surprises.
